# screen capture

### 1

in 607_screen_capture : main-double_face allows you to do an automatic screenshot, with double sided faces.

Usage :

```shell
607_screen_capture.bin myplyfile.ply
```

It outputs out.png in ~/tmp/ which you can use however you like.

### 2

in 607_screen_capture : main allows you to 360 screenshots around an object to make a video around it.

Usage :

```shell
607_screen_capture.bin myplyfile.ply #make sure color attributes are passed as normal attributes by replacing "blue" by "nx", "red" by "ny", "green" by "nz" in PLY file.
```

It outputs out[1-360].png in ~/tmp/ which you can use however you like.

Though I recommend using ffmpeg to make a video out of it.

It heavily not optimised because i don't use it much and I don't know libigl well enough to do better in a short time.

### 3

```shell
ffmpeg -framerate 20 -i %4d.ply.obj.png output.mp4
```



## Coding guidelines for future libigl edits

* I can directly edit the vertex and fragment shader in "main.cpp"
* ReadPLY only loads vertex position, normals and texture coordinates. It's hard to edit to load color attributes and other type of attributes. As attributes can't be stored in *.obj* and *.off* , i pass them as normal by editing the PLY file when i need them. It's dirty, I know (but fast!). 
* I use global variables to pass attributes to callback function post_draw.
